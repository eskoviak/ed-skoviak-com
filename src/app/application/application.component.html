    <h3>Where Do We Go From Here?</h3>
    <p>
        Architecture in any sense of its definition—&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Art or science of building; A method or style of building; Construction … frame or structure; Architectural product&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; [Webster New International Dictionary 2nd Edition, 1950]—requires a product or something to be built.  Does the architect do this for the pure aesthetic?  Perhaps.  In many cases though and certainly in business, the product or service provided serves the goals of the enterprise.
