      Ed Skoviak Computing (ESC) is an advisory practice, dedicated to helping companies establish an Enterprise
      Architecture practice.  We believe that this practice is most successful when it is built organically within the company's
      Ethos.  This means that that our practicioners partner with your senior IT staff to find and coach individuals in your
      exsiting organization to create the basis of your Enterprise Architecture Center of Excellence (CoE).
    </p>
    <p>
      ESC defines Enterprise Architecture as the holistic view of the Information Technology (IT) stack in a company.  Our approach blends a focus on the architecture of Business, Data, Architecture, and Technology (BDAT) with the uniqueness of a firm's IT structure. What this means is that we apply the rigor of BDAT to the existing expertise in your firm to deliver (or enhance)  a CoE (practice).
    </p>
    <p>This approach is less focused on titles (Business Architect, Enterprise Architect, etc.) but rather on a practice of Architecture within a group of IT experts.</p>
    <p>
      Some hallmarks of this practice are:
    </p>
          <ol>
        <li>Understanding Current State (baseline).</li>
        <li>A comprehensive roadmap across all business units looking 3-5 years out.</li>
        <li>Establish partnerships with internal and external stakeholders.</li>
        <li>DOCUMENTATION and GOVERNANCE.</li>
        </ol>
    <p> 
      In many companies, the IT systems appear as a patchwork of systems.  There are several causes for this (not an exhaustive
      list):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expansion of a business capability</li>
      <li>New business capability arises</li>
      <li>Merger/Acquisition</li>
      <li>Market Base growth</li>
      <li>Addition or removal of third party tools</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Too often, this expansion of IT footprint happens in a silo&mdash;especially in a firm with multiple business 
      functions&mdash;resulting in a piecemeal Architecture.  We believe the practice approach will bring order to the chaos.
