    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Architecture, as defined by the Webster New International Dictionary (2nd Edition, 1950), encompasses “Art or science of building; A method or style of building; Construction â€¦ frame or structure; Architectural product.” This definition implies that architecture necessitates a product or structure to be created. For the enterprise architect, the <i>product</i> provided serves as guidance to stakeholders.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stakeholders play a crucial role in strategically driving the business towards its mission. They are involved in all aspects of the business, including defining processes, technology, and the individuals responsible for executing these processes.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">One group of stakeholders is the C-Suite officers. Each department (line, business unit, etc.) has a specific role in the enterprise, and all are dependent on IT in some capacity. The various C-level officers are accountable to the CEO for a business function they are entrusted to manage efficiently, ensuring cost-effectiveness and maximum productivity.</span></p>
    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Another group of stakeholders is the technology itself.</span></p>
