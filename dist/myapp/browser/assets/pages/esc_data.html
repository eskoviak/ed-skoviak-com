    The importance of architecture and data quality are paramount to the success of modern, data-driven initiatives, particularly in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI).  It is imperative that the architecture of data platforms is designed to support scalability, flexibility, and reliability to meet the evolving needs of enterprises.

    The current centralized and monolithic enterprise data platform architecture (like a traditional data lake) is the primary cause of the failure of many data initiatives, as it cannot scale adequately for enterprises with rich domains and numerous sources and consumers. A paradigm shift toward a data mesh is necessary, adopting a distributed data architecture where the architectural quantum is the business domain, not the processing pipeline stage.

    In a distributed data architecture (data mesh), data must be treated as a product that is trustworthy and truthful. Data product owners must define and assure an acceptable Service Level Objective (SLO) for data integrity. Data quality is the lifeblood of AI, and without high-quality data, AI systems cannot function effectively.
