    The Technology Layer is responsible for the technical implementation of the system, including the infrastructure, platforms, and tools used to support the application layer. It encompasses the hardware, software, and network components that enable the application to function effectively and efficiently.

    Architects working at this layer focus on ensuring scalability, reliability, security, and performance of the technology stack. They make decisions regarding cloud services, databases, middleware, and other technical resources that form the backbone of the system

    Key considerations at the Technology Layer include selecting appropriate technologies, designing for fault tolerance, optimizing resource utilization, and ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices.  But this is only one part of the overall architecture.  The Enterprise Architecture practice guides the alignment of technology with business goals, ensuring that the technology layer supports the broader objectives of the organization.  The business fuctions (in the Data and Application layers) must be supported by the technology layer, and the technology layer must be designed to meet the needs of the business.
